TODO
1. Fix casting str and number
2. Fix print issue
3. (check for variables within code block)
4. Make sure variable name on contains letter or letter with number or _only
sunekeh nyet mohopah nyaar:
        wonel("'True\"'")
kon:
        wonel(Falseisdifesfdf)
5. Numbers should be separated from lex tokens to prevent tokens like kon from passing value checks
6. Keyboard interupt error on taking input. (Potential fix use string template to wrap input with try catch and display custom error)
7. Test wonel(name())
8. defkatValue = tur(): (Enhance the error message for this line )
9. boolean x == y -> dudegah/dega
10. equality checks {x mohemak y} / {x emutak y}
11. Pass arguments to functions

NOTE:
variable must be initialized
variable name with newline in between is treated as single variable
{{
 amut
tur
}}
becomes "amuttur"

variable declaration should happen in only one scope.
{{amuttur}}

not
{{amuttur}}
{{amuttur}}

The code below will be ignored during compilation.
But, python will throw an error during execution.
sunekeh bena mohopah nyaar:
        wonel("Dega")
        amut = "1012"
kon:
        wonel(amut)

Allowed data types [] {} number and string
Only positive numbers as allowed()
floats are rounded to to the nearest number .75 becomes .8
{bena yoka nyaar}asds
    Throws error. Fix print statement

first line after code block cannot be whitespace
    sunekeh bena:

        bena
    (This will throw error)

    (Correct)
    sunekeh bena:
        bena

The code below will not work as the arithmetics operations are done at build time.

Replace wonel("senAt " + senAt) with wonel("senAt " yoka senAt)
